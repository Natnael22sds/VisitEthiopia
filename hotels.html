The hotel was built by MIDROC Ethiopia, and designed by architect Kosek Ivo. 
Sheik Mohammed Hussein Al Amoudi, built the hotel as a way of creating jobs and promoting the country's image- saying that he is "investing in Ethiopia by following my heart, not my head".
The hotel cost over $200 million to build, and over 500 families had to be relocated for its construction. It opened on 29 February 1998, and has been considered one of the country's leading hotels. 
The hotel is located between two palaces, the National Palace (formerly the Jubilee Palace), which is the residence of the President of Ethiopia, and the Menelik Palace, residence of the Prime Minister of Ethiopia.
The hotel has hosted countless high-profile events, including Pan-African and African Union summits, 
as well as New Year's Eve celebrations with special performances by world-renowned artists such as Beyonce, Ludacris, The Black Eyed Peas, Rihanna and Akon, among other guests.
The hotel has been host to a number of celebrities, including the aforementioned performers; indeed, most, if not all, choose to stay in the Sheraton when in Ethiopia, according to The Independent. 
Among the many guests include Tony Blair, Rita Marley, Princess Anne, Jimmy Carter, and Bill Clinton.
Doormen at the Sheraton Addis.
Confusingly, the Sheraton Addis is not part of the Sheraton Hotels and Resorts hotel chain, but rather is a part of The Luxury Collection. 
Since it was built, the hotel has been part of The Luxury Collection. 
There are two other remaining hotels that are part of The Luxury Collection but that operate with the name Sheraton, but not technically part of Sheraton—the Sheraton Grande Sukhumvit (Bangkok, Thailand) and Sheraton Kuwait (Kuwait City, Kuwait).
In 2018, following the acquisition of Starwood by Marriott International, the Reporter newspaper reported the hotel's name would be changed to the Marriott Addis. 
However, this was later denied by hotel management.
Labour dispute
In February 2011, a labour dispute over compensation threatened to close the hotel. 
In late 2010, a union was formed at the hotel, and in December got involved in a dispute of the distribution of profits from service charges. The workers, who were already the most well-paid hotel employees in the country, taking home 5,337 Ethiopian Birr (US$283) on average per month, felt that the sharing of the service charges was not sufficient. 
The union argued that management should be excluded from the proceeds which would increase salaries by 52 birr. 
Sheik Hussein said that he felt "unappreciated and unrecognised" for his "generosity to employees of the hotel", and threatened to close the hotel for expansion work. 
The crisis was solved before the 15 February deadline.</p>

The hotel stands within a short walking distance to the United Nations Conference center and within a 15 min.  drive to the African Union Headquarters with the largest conference facilities in the country.

The presidential palace, government and business offices are also within short reach of the hotel.
